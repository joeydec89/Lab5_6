What I have learned: 
In this lab, I learned how to enable the I2C interface on the Raspberry Pi, connect an I2C temperature sensor, 
and write a Python program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to read temperature data. I gained practical experience with the SMBus library 
how to structure code into classes for better organization and maintainability.

What I believe I need to improve: I need to work on my understanding of OOP concepts, 
particularly around encapsulation and inheritance, to write more complex and modular code. Additionally, .
I could improve my troubleshooting skills, especially when dealing with I2C connections and sensor data retrieval.

What the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier: 
i found everything was pretty good.

What I could have done to make the learning easier:
I could have reviewed OOP concepts before starting the lab to better grasp how to implement them in Python. Spending time experimenting with smaller pieces of the code, 
such as just reading sensor data, might have helped me understand how to integrate the different elements effectively.

Other reflections: iam happy with everything we learned.
